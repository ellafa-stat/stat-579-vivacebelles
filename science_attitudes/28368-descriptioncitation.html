		        		<h2>Project Description:</h2>
								<p><span><strong>Summary:</strong> The National Science Foundation (NSF) Surveys of Public Attitudes monitored the general public's attitudes toward and interest in science and technology. The survey assessed levels of literacy and understanding of scientific and environmental concepts and constructs such as DNA, probability, and experimental methods, how scientific knowledge and information were acquired, attentiveness to public policy issues, and computer access and usage. Since 1979, the survey was administered at regular intervals (occurring every two or three years), producing 12 cross-sectional surveys through 2006. Respondents were asked how they received information concerning science or news (e.g., via newspapers, magazines, or television), what types of television programming they watched, and what kinds of magazines they read. They were also asked if they agreed with statements concerning science and technology and how they affect everyday living. Respondents were further asked a series of true and false questions regarding science-based statements (e.g., the center of the Earth is hot, all radioactivity is manmade, electrons are smaller than atoms, etc.). Additional topics included whether the respondent had a postsecondary degree, field of highest degree, number of science-based college courses taken, major in college, household ownership of a computer, access to the World Wide Web, number of hours spent on a computer at home or at work, and topics searched for via the Internet. Demographic variables include gender, race, age, marital status, number of people in household, level of education, and occupation.</span></p>
